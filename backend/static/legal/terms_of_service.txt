---

6. Agreement Generation and Signatures

---

a. Base Agreement
• When a Contractor and Homeowner agree on scope, price, and Milestones, the Platform generates a base Agreement.
• The base Agreement includes:
1\. Parties’ names and contact information
2\. Project scope of work and deliverables
3\. Milestone schedule and payment (escrow) terms
4\. Standard Warranty clause (if Warranty Duration is specified)
5\. Escrow rules and fund release procedure
6\. Dispute Resolution process
7\. Limitation of Liability and Indemnification provisions
8\. Electronic signature blocks for both parties

b. Electronic Signatures
• Both Contractor and Homeowner must electronically sign the base Agreement.
• Each signature is captured as a typed name, timestamp, and IP address.
• Electronic signatures have the same legal force and effect as handwritten signatures.

c. Warranty Clause (Default)
• If the Contractor specifies a Warranty Duration (in months) but does not upload a supplemental PDF, the Platform automatically inserts the following standard Warranty clause into the base Agreement:

```
 Section X: Workmanship Warranty  
 
 The Contractor warrants to the Homeowner that all labor and workmanship performed under this Agreement shall be free from defects for a period of {Warranty Duration} months following the date of final acceptance of work. During this Warranty period, the Contractor shall, at no additional cost to the Homeowner, correct or replace any portion of the work found to be defective or not in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

 Warranty Exclusions:  
   1. Normal wear and tear, settlement, or damage caused by misuse, abuse, accident, neglect, or natural disasters (e.g., floods, earthquakes).  
   2. Damage resulting from lack of proper maintenance, modifications, or repairs performed by parties other than the Contractor.  
   3. Materials, appliances, or fixtures supplied by third parties (e.g., HVAC units, tile, cabinets) are covered only by the original manufacturer’s warranty.  
   4. Minor cosmetic imperfections (e.g., small cracks in grout, paint touch-ups) unless specifically noted in writing before final acceptance.

 Claim Process:  
   • The Homeowner must provide written notice to the Contractor at the address listed on page 1 of this Agreement, including a description and photographic evidence of the alleged defect, within {Warranty Duration} months of final acceptance.  
   • The Contractor shall inspect any claimed defect within ten (10) business days of receiving notice. If the defect is covered under this Warranty, the Contractor will initiate repair or replacement work within thirty (30) calendar days.  
   • If the Contractor fails to cure the defect within the specified timeframe, the Homeowner may engage a licensed third party to perform the repair. The Contractor agrees to reimburse the Homeowner for reasonable costs up to a maximum of 125% of the Contractor’s original cost for that portion of the work, upon receipt of proper invoices and documentation.

 Limitation of Liability for Warranty Claims:  
   • The above remedies are the sole and exclusive remedies for breach of this Warranty.  
   • Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be liable for any incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of or in connection with this Warranty.  
```

7. Contractor Uploads and Addenda

---

a. Supplemental Contract / Warranty PDF
• Contractors may upload a supplemental contract or warranty (“Addendum”) in PDF format that will be appended to the base Agreement.
• MyHomeBro does not vet, endorse, or guarantee the legal validity of any Contractor-supplied Addendum. Any terms contained in an Addendum are the sole responsibility of the Contractor.
• If a Contractor uploads an Addendum, the final Agreement PDF will consist of:
1\. The MyHomeBro-generated base Agreement (including any default Warranty clause).
2\. The Contractor’s uploaded Addendum, appended immediately after the base Agreement.

b. Conflict of Terms
• If an Addendum’s terms conflict with mandatory provisions in these Terms or in the MyHomeBro base Agreement (for example, limiting arbitration rights in a manner not permitted by law), the base Agreement’s language will prevail to the extent required by law.

c. Acknowledgment of Addenda
• By signing the Agreement, both Contractor and Homeowner acknowledge and accept the contents of the Addendum (if any) as part of the Agreement.
• Contractors agree to honor all Addendum provisions. Failure to honor Addendum commitments may result in platform penalties, suspension, or removal from MyHomeBro.

---

8. Escrow and Payments

---

a. Escrow Setup
• Homeowners fund project payments into a third-party escrow account (Stripe).
• Funds are held in escrow until Milestone conditions are met.

b. Milestone Releases
• When a Contractor marks a Milestone as complete, the Homeowner has a defined acceptance window (e.g., 5 business days) to confirm.
• If the Homeowner confirms completion or if the window closes without dispute, funds are released to the Contractor.

c. Platform Fees
• MyHomeBro charges a transaction fee equal to 5% of the total project cost, which is deducted from each Milestone release.
• Contractors agree to these fees at the time of account creation.
• Homeowners are also responsible for any payment processing or currency conversion fees charged by Stripe.

d. Payment Disputes
• If a Homeowner disputes a Milestone, they must use the Platform’s messaging and dispute resolution tools.
• The disputed funds remain in escrow until the dispute is resolved or escalated to arbitration as set forth in Section 9.

---

9. Dispute Resolution

---

a. Milestone-Level Disputes
• Homeowners and Contractors should attempt to resolve disputes informally via the Platform’s messaging system.
• If informal resolution fails, either party may request MyHomeBro’s mediation service. MyHomeBro will assign a neutral third party to review documentation and provide a non-binding recommendation within 10 business days.

b. Final Disputes and Arbitration
• If either party rejects a mediation recommendation, or if the dispute pertains to final project payment or major defects after project completion, both parties agree to binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in Bexar County, Texas.
• The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator.
• You may seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to or during arbitration if necessary to prevent irreparable harm.

---

10. Termination

---

a. Account Termination by MyHomeBro
• MyHomeBro may suspend or terminate your account if you:
1\. Violate these Terms, any Platform policies, or applicable laws.
2\. Provide false or misleading information.
3\. Engage in fraudulent activity or non-payment.
4\. Misuse the Platform or harass other users.
• Termination may include removal of your account, deletion of data, or permanent ban.

b. Account Termination by User
• You may deactivate your account at any time by emailing [support@myhomebro.com](mailto:support@myhomebro.com).
• Deactivation will prevent new projects, but any active Agreements or outstanding obligations must still be honored (e.g., completing an in-progress project, resolving any disputes, or fulfilling warranties).

c. Project-Level Cancellation
• Prior to final signatures, either party may cancel the project without penalty.
• After signatures, cancellation must comply with the base Agreement’s cancellation and termination clauses.
• Any prepaid escrow funds will be refunded to the Homeowner only if mutually agreed or per the dispute/mediation process.
